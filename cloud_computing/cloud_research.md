#### What is CLoud Computing?
- Using a public cloud is about using other people’s servers to run your digital workloads. 
#### How do we know if something is in the Cloud (on-prem vs the cloud)?
- On-premise software is installed and runs on a company's own hardware infrastructure, and is hosted locally
- whereas cloud software is stored and managed on the provider's servers, and accessed through a web browser or other interface.
#### What are some popular cloud computing services and how are they used?
- Dropbox, Google drive, onedrive, s3 
- Store data 
- manage data 
- run applications / websites
- deliver content e.g. Netflix
#### Explain the four main cloud deployment models
- ##### Private
  - Dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or dedicated hosted by a third-party provider.
  - Provides greater control, security, and customization.
  - Typically more expensive and requires in-house IT expertise.
- ##### Community
  - Shared infrastructure among multiple organizations with common interests (e.g., government agencies, healthcare institutions).
  - Provides better security and compliance than public clouds while reducing costs compared to private clouds.
  - Limited scalability compared to public cloud options.
- ##### Public
  - Owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
  - Resources are shared among multiple users (multi-tenancy).
  - Cost-effective but offers less control over security and compliance.
- ##### Hybrid 
  - Combines public and private clouds to enable workload portability.
  - Organizations can store sensitive data in a private cloud while leveraging the scalability of the public cloud.
  - Requires proper integration and management to function efficiently.

#### Explain the three main types of cloud service
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - products offer services that are meant to be accessed by the end users. an example would be using your gmail to log in through a browser interface or an email client such as outlook.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Stimulates the look and feeling you would get from managing physical resources. 
  - Direct access to a providers compute. storage and networking assets. therefore the ability to configure every level of your operating stack
- Platform as a Service (Paas)
  -  these are products that allow you to simplify the process of building an application by hiding the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it.
  -  the interface allows you to define the behaviour and environment of your application.

#### What are some of the main advantages of the cloud?
- Trade capital expense for variable expense 
  - only  pay for what you use
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - You can scale up very quickly without having to worry about hardware or infrastructure.
- Stop guessing about capacity.
  - You can just scale up as you don’t have to worry about purchasing anything.
- Increase speed and agility.
  - You can scale up instantly or change your services instantly.
- Focus on what matters.
  - Due to not having to worry about the things AWS cover. peace of mind
- Global in minutes.

#### What are some potential pitfalls/disadvantages of using the cloud?
- Downtime and reliability issues
- Security & privacy risks
- Limited control & flexibility
- Vendor Lock in
- Performance issues
- compliance & legal issues

#### Who are the biggest Cloud providers?
- AWS
- Azure
- GCP
